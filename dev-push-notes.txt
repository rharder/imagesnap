Make changes in xcode etc.
After all commits are done:

git tag -a 0.2.14
git push --tags

This tags the state.  Don't include a 'v' as in v0.2.14.  Just do the version numbers 0.2.14.

Then go to github to the release page https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap/releases

Select "Draft a new release" and select the tag above, eg, 0.2.14. 
I think the release name can be anything, but I've been doing v0.2.14 (with a 'v').
I've been taking the imagesnap binary, adding a version number to the name, and 
adding it to the release, but it's only the x64 version, not arm.

Then do a homebrew update:

brew bump-formula-pr --strict imagesnap --tag=v0.3.1 --version=0.3.1

This updates homebrew but I think a homebrew staff human reviews it before it goes final.

## MacPorts

The team member who watches imagesnap, and many others, is Ryan Schmidt (ryandesign).
In an email to me dated 13 March 2021 he said he runs a script periodically that
refreshes the ports as long as I have tags and releases on github, which the above
instructions take care of.
